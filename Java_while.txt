				While loop
			-----------------------------------------------------

Loop can execute a set of statements as long as condition is met
Loops make code more readable
The While loop loops through a block of code as long as the condition is specified

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}

				Do/While loop
			---------------------------------------------------------

this is a variant of while loop. This will execute the block of code once without checking the condition and then executes the code as long 
as the condition is true.

NOTE : Don't forget to increase the variable by some amount otherwise the loop will never end.
