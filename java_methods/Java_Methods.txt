					Methods
				-------------------------------------------
A method is a block of codes that only runs when it is called . You can pass (parameters) into a method
We use methods to reuse code
Methods are defined / declared inside the class

public class Main {

static void myMethod () 
	{
	// code block
	}
}


static -  means that method belongs to the main class, not the object of the main class
void - means that this method does not have any return value

					Calling a method
				-----------------------------------------------------
A method can be called multiple times

public static void main(String[] args) {
	myMethod();
	myMethod();
}
