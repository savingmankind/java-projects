					Scope
				---------------------------------------
In Java variables are only accessible inside the region they are created. This is called the scope

					Method Scope
				-------------------------------------------

Variables declared directly inside the method are available anywhere inside the method following the line of the code in which 
that variable was declared

public static void main(String[] args) {

	// code here cannot access the variable x

	int x = 24;

	// code here can access the variable x
	
	System.out.println(x);
}

					Block Access
				---------------------------------------------------
block of code refers to the code between curly braces {}
a variable declared inside the block of code can only be accessed by the code 
inside that block following the line where that variable was declared

public static void main (String[] args) {

	// code here cannot access variable x

		{ // block starts

			// code here cannot access the variable x

			int x = 24;
			
			// code here can access the variable x
		} // block ends

	// code here cannot access the variable x
			}
