					Lambda
				-----------------------------------------

Lambda expressions were added  in java 8.
Lambda expression is a short block of code that takes in parameters and returns a value.
Similar to methods but they don't need name and can be implemented right in the body of the method.

parameter -> expression
(parameter1, parameter2) -> expression
(parameter1, parameter2) -> {code block}
