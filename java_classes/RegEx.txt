					Regular expressions
				-------------------------------------------------------

sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
java doesn't have a built in package for regular expression but we can import java.util.regex to work with regular expressions.
package includes following classes :

Pattern	-	defines a pattern (to be used in a search)
Matcher	-	used to search for pattern
PatternSyntaxException  - indicates syntax error in a regular expression pattern

		// pattern is created using Pattern.compile
		Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("w3school", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
		// Matcher is used to search for a pattern in a string
		Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("Visit W3School");
		// find method return true/false
		boolean matchFound = matcher.find();
		if(matchFound) { 
			System.out.println("Match Found");
		}else {
			System.out.println("Match not Found");
		}


flags in compile()
------------------------------

Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE : case of letter will be ignored
Pattern.LITERAL : Special character in a patttern will not have any special meaning
Pattern.UNICODE_CASE : use it together with CASE_INSENSITIVE flag to also ignore the case of letters outside of english alphabet.

Regular expression pattern
------------------------------------------

the first parameter of the Pattern.compile() method is the pattern. it described what is being searched for.
Brackets are used to find a range of characters.
[abc]    :    find one character from the options between the brackets
[^abc]   :    find one character not between the brackets
[0-9]      :    find one character from range 0 to 9
