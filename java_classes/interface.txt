						Interfaces
					--------------------------------------------

An interface is a "complete abstract" class that is used to group related method together with empty bodies

we just don't write abstract keyword in front of methods when we use interface


interface Animal {

	public void animalSound();
	public void run();

}

to access the interface methods, the interface class must be implemented (like inherited) by another class with "implements" keyword
(instead of extends)

an interface cannot contain constructor as it cannot be used to create objects
on implementation of interface, we override all the methods
interface methods are by deafult abstract and public

						Why use interface

to achieve security and hode certain details and only show important details

IMPORTANT

	Java does not support "multiple inheritance" ( a class can only inherit one superclass)
	but is can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces.
