					Methods
				-----------------------------------------
Methods are declared within a class and are used to perform certain actions.
Methods are called using two parenthesis followed by a semi colon.

public class Main {
	
	static void myMethod() {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}

	public static void main (String[] args) {
		myMethod();
	}		
}

					Static Vs non-static methods
				-----------------------------------------------------------------


Static methdos can be called without creating the objects for the class 
wheras
Non-static or public methods can only be called by using objects
Methods without any keyword (static or public) are considered as non-static
