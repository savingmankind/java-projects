					Encapsulation
				-------------------------------------------------
To make sure that the "sensitive data" is hidden from the users. For this we have to :

	declare class variables or attributes as private
	provide public get and set methods to update the values of private variables



					Get and set methods
				---------------------------------------------------
we know that private variables can only be accessed within the same class (an aoutside class has no access to it) 
But its possible to access them if we provide public get and set methods for these variables

get method returns the variable value 
set method sets the value

public class Person {

	private String name;

	public String getName() {

		return name;
	}	
	
	public void setName(String newName) {
		this.name = newName;
	}
}


					Why Encapsulation ?	
				--------------------------------------------------------------

better control of class attributes
we can change one part of the code without affecting the other
increased security of data
