has all of the same methods as arraylist 

How array list works

is created to replace the old one and old one is removed.

how linked list works

linked list stores items in containers. The list has link to first container and each container has link to next conatiner. To add an element 
to the list , the element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other conatiners
in the list.
