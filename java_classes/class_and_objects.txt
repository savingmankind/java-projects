					class/objects
				------------------------------------------------
example: Car
 A class has attributes (variables) like weight and color
and methods like drive, brake
class name should start with an uppercase and java file name should be same as class name

public class Car{
	double weight = 100;
	String color = "Whilte";
}

			
	Creating an Object
------------------------------------------------------

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Car myCar1 = new Car();
	Car myCar2 = new Car();
}

now this object can access all the attributes of class Car
	myCar.weight
	myCar.color


					Using multiple classes
				------------------------------------------------------------------

we can also create an object of a class and access it in another class 
for better organization of classes
one class will have all the attributes (parameters) and methods and other contains the main method

public class Main {
	int x =5;
}

class Second {
Main myObj = new Main();
System.out.println(myObj.x);
}

NOTE : first class is declared public to access its attributes (parameters) in second
